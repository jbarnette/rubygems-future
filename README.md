# RubyGems Future Speculation

An isolated repo for trying out new object model ideas for RubyGems.

## Development

Put a clone of RubyGems master in a `rubygems` directory next to this
one. Because this is kind of a meta thing, test deps are
vendored. `rake test` does what you'd expect.

I mostly dev with 1.9.2, but I periodically check things with 1.8.6,
1.8.7, REE 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, MRI's head, JRuby's latest release,
MacRuby's latest release, and Rubinius' latest release.
